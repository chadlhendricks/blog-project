      Paul Bothner Music’s South African origins date back to around 1902, when
      Charles Bothner, a piano tuner by trade, emigrated from Switzerland and
      set up shop in Cape Town. The business was soon importing and selling
      pianos. Over the next 50 years, with contributions from his wife and sons,
      Paul Bothner became a household name, nationwide.

    <h1>Woodstock!</h1>

    <p>
      1969 saw the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Santana, Jefferson Airplane, and The
      Who performing at the legendary Woodstock festival. This was a vibrant
      period for music, and a fitting time for the founding of Paul Bothner
      Music in its current form, as a full­-service musical instrument and
      equipment retailer!

      Starting with one store in Claremont, Cape Town, the business has now
      expanded to 11 Bothners stores located around South Africa and an online
      store. Our online store offers you the same winning formula of
      professional advice, great product selection, and full after­-sales
      service nationwide.
